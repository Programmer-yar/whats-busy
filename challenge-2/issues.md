## django-registration
### This package throws lots of issues.

Even though I have included one step url, it keeps asking to add 'ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION DAYS', registration email templates and some other stuff which I do not find necessery to include.
It has taken quite sometime, it would have been very easy if I had built registration views from scratch.
